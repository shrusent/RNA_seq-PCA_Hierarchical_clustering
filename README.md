# RNA_seq-PCA_Hierarchical_clustering

Implementation of Principal Component Analysis algorithm (PCA) to run your program over RNA-Seq (HiSeq) PANCAN data set https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/401/gene+expression+cancer+rna+seq - the data contains the gene expressions of patients having 5 different types of tumor: BRCA, KIRC, COAD, LUAD and PRAD which we will be using as our data labels to answer the questions. 
Data Preparation: Similar to any other data mining problem, before feeding the data to the clustering algorithms,  appropriate data cleaning, feature engineering, and feature selection on this dataset are performed.

Principal component analysis algorithm, Hierarchical clustering methods are implemented from scratch on RNA sequence data. Dendograms are then used to visualize the clusters. Various forms of clustering such as Kmeans and hierarchical methods with and without PCA are compared to check the performance of these models on the dataset.
